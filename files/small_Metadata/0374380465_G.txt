Description ===Sequel to The Ghost of Fossil Glen, winner of the Texas Bluebonnet Award. Just a few weeks after making it possible for the police to capture Lucy Stiles's killer -- with the help of Lucy's ghost -- eleven-year-old Allie Nichols is visited by another disembodied voice. Her friend Dub Whitwell decides she must be a "ghost magnet." Somehow, the new ghost is connected with the school's fearsome cafeteria lady, Mrs. Hobbs. Allie means to understand the connection, and to help the unsettled ghost find peace in the hereafter. Little does she know that what the ghost wants is not peace but revenge. And as the vengeful ghost begins to threaten people, including Allie's little brother, Allie discovers through her relationships with the ghost and Mrs. Hobbs, and through her friendship with Dub, that jealousy can indeed be a monster. Cynthia DeFelice, a master of suspense, succeeds once again in creating a ghost as credible as any of her "real" characters, in a story as meaningful as it is entertaining.===
