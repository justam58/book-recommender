Notes:         Eleven-year-old Nicholas Vargas only thinks his life
                  has been turned upside down after his developer
                  father remarries and moves his new wife and daughter
                  into the soon-to-be completed Mangrove Hollow. But
                  an "expedition" to a nearby lake turns up a little
                  nixie with a giant problem--the huge, lumbering,
                  fire-breathing variety--and it's up to Nick, his
                  stepsister Laurie, and his big brother, Julian (plus
                  a familiar face from the original Spiderwick
                  Chronicles) to figure out the best way to stop a
                  host of rampaging giants before all of Florida goes
                  up in smoke.--From publisher's description.
