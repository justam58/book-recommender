Notes:         Something that I still could hardly make out was
                  flying round and round the room, I could see wings,
                  scales, and a wisp of smoke rising from its
                  nostrils. I saw it fly over to the other side of the
                  room, positioning itself directly opposite me. With
                  wings outspread and claws at the ready, it fixed me
                  with its beady eyes and began to fly straight at
                  me.
