               Logan and his friend Benedict are playing tag in the
                  library. Logan gets caught when he runs into a
                  mysterious man. When Logan doesn't apologize
                  sincerely, the mysterious gentleman punishes him by

                  examples each of oxymorons, anagrams and palindromes
                  within the time limits will return Logan to normal.
