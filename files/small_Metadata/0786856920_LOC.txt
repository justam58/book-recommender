Notes:         Homeschooled by his hippie grandmother, Capricorn
                  (Cap) Anderson has never watched television, tasted
                  a pizza, or even heard of a wedgie, but when his
                  grandmother lands in the hospital, Cap is forced to
                  move in with a guidance counselor and attend the
                  local middle school. While Cap knows a lot about
                  tie-dyeing and Zen Buddhism, no education could
                  prepare him for the politics of public school.
