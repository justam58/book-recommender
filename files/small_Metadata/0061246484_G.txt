At seven and a half years old (for now), she's worried about spelling and about Willa Jean getting all the attention. Most of all, she's worried that her mother may not love her anymore. Ramona Forever It is a time of change for Ramona and her family. Aunt Beatrice is getting married, Ramona's father is looking for a new teaching job, and Ramona's mother suddenly seems a little thicker around the middle.

Ramona's World Ramona can't wait for school to start -- she's sure fourth grade will be the best year of her life. With a new baby sister, a new best friend, Daisy, and some glorious new calluses on her hands from the rings in the park, Ramona is on top of the world!===
