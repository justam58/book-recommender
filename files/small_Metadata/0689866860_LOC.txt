               Ted Hammond, the only sixth grader in his small
                  Nebraska town's one-room schoolhouse, searches for
                  clues to the disappearance of a homeless family. Ted
                  Hammond loves a good mystery, and in the spring of
                  his fifth-grade year, he's working on a big one. How
                  can his school in the little town of Plattsford stay
                  open next year if there are going to be only five
                  students? Out here on the Great Plains in western
                  Nebraska, everyone understands that if you lose the
                  school, you lose the town. But the mystery that has
                  Ted's full attention at the moment is about that
                  face, the face he sees in the upper window of the
                  Andersons' house as he rides past on his paper
                  route. The Andersons moved away two years ago, and
                  their old farmhouse is empty, boarded up tight. At
                  least it's supposed to be. A shrinking school in a
                  dying town. A face in the window of an empty house.
                  At first these facts don't seem to be related. But
                  Ted Hammond learns that in a very small town,
                  there's no such thing as an isolated event. And the
                  solution of one mystery is often the beginning of
                  another.
