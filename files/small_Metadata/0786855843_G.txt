Description ===Best friends Annabelle Doll and Tiffany Funcraft are back, and this time they’ve got an unexpected visitor, a new doll named Tilly May. She's arrived in a mysterious package from London, but her face looks so familiar... . Could she be Annabelle’s long lost baby sister? Annabelle is convinced it absolutely must be so—but her parents refuse to believe her. With time running out before the package is at risk of being sent back to England, Annabelle and Tiffany resort to the only course of action they can think of—running away. But life on the road is fraught with its own pitfalls, from a foreboding wooded park to a close call in a department store. How will Annabelle and Tiffany find their way back home…and what’s going to happen to Tilly May if and when they do? In this masterfully plotted third book in the Doll People series, Ann M. Martin and Laura Godwin, with the help of Brian Selznick’s captivating black-and-white illustrations, take the reader on another exhilarating adventure from a doll’s-eye view.===
