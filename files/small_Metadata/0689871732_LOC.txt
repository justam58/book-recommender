               Everyone knows the story of Jack and the beanstalk.
                  Everyone also knows that Jack's little adventure
                  made him a very rich man. But what they don't know
                  is what happened a long time after Jack.... That's
                  where Nick comes in. Orphaned and desperate, Nick
                  joins a rugged band of thieves in hopes of a warm
                  meal and a little protection. In exchange Nick must
                  help them break into the lavish white castle rumored
                  to belong to an old man named Jack. Legend says it's
                  full of riches from Jack's quest up a magical
                  beanstalk decades ago. When Nick's dangerous mission
                  leads him straight to Jack, he sees a chance to
                  climb the famed beanstalk himself. But what Nick
                  doesn't know is that things are different from when
                  Jack made his climb. There are new foes at the top
                  now. Ones with cruel weapons and foul plans -- plans
                  that could destroy the world as Nick knows it. Will
                  Nick come down the beanstalk a hero? Will he come
                  down at all?
