Notes:         Eleven-year-old Julep feels invisible. At home,
                  sandwiched between perfect older sister, Harmony,
                  and obnoxious younger brother, Cooper, she is only
                  noticed when her parents want something from
                  her--such as when they want her to trade her nice,
                  uncarpeted bedroom for asthmatic Cooper's disgusting
                  one (aka the Chicken Coop), with its dirty carpet
                  and "snot green" walls. At school, Julep gets
                  attention, but not the kind she wants: her journal
                  is read over the loudspeaker and she barfs in gym.
                  Her priorities and her sense of self-worth, however,
                  take a dramatic turn when her parents are away and
                  she must take charge when her brother has a severe
                  asthma attack.
