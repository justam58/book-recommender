               Chrissa Maxwell moves to a new school in the middle of
                  the year, and the girls in her fourth-grade class
                  are decidedly unfriendly. On the advice of her
                  grandmother, Chrissa tries first to be nice, and
                  then to ignore the mean girls. But they just won't
                  quit, and when the teasing turns into serious
                  bullying, Chrissa must find the courage to stand
                  strong and speak out.
