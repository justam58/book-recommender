Notes:         "Fourteen-year-old Maximum Ride knows what it's like
                  to soar above the world. She and all the members of
                  her 'flock'-- Fang, Iggy, Nudge, Gasman, and Angel--
                  are just like ordinary kids, except they have wings
                  and can fly! It may seem like a dream come true to
                  some, but for the flock it's more like a living
                  nightmare when the mysterious lab known as the
                  'School' turns up and kidnaps their youngest member.
                  Now it's up to Max to organize a rescue, but will
                  help come in time?" -- p. [4] of cover.
