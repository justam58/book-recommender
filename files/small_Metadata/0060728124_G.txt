With a little help from her pets, Wag the dog, Lightfoot the cat, and Lester the pig—and a trunk full of magnificent powders and potions—she can solve any problem, big or small. And while Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle is working her magic, the children are working some of their own, planning a boisterous birthday bash for everyone's favorite problem solver! Just in time for the sixtieth anniversary of the original Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle comes a healthy dose of comedy and adventure to delight a whole new generation of readers.===
