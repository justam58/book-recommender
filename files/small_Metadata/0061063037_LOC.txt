Notes:         Cindy Blake wants to stay at Whitebrook Farm forever.
                  After being shuffled from one foster home to
                  another, she's finally found a place where people
                  love her and, best of all, where she's surrounded by
                  horses. Then Lavinia Townsend accuses Cindy of
                  stealing. The authorities want to send her to
                  another home, and even her new foster parents seem
                  to doubt her. Cindy's troubles multiply when she
                  discovers a mistreated horse and hides him. If they
                  find out she's stolen a horse, she'll have to leave
                  Whitebrook Farm for sure!
