               "After the tragic death of their father, Emily and
                  Navin move with their mother to the home of her
                  deceased great-grandfather, but the strange house
                  proves to be dangerous. Before long, a sinister
                  creature lures the kids' mom through a door in the
                  basement. Em and Navin, desperate not to lose her,
                  follow her into an underground world inhabited by
                  demons, robots, and talking animals. Eventually,
                  they enlist the help of a small mechanical rabbit
                  named Miskit. Together with Miskit, they face the
                  most terrifying monster of all, and Em finally has
                  the chance to save someone she loves"--Publisher's
