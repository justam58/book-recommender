               "Then Fudge said, 'Mr. Green, was this a catastrophe?'
                  And Mr. Green laughed and said, 'Not quite, Fudge.
                  But I'm sure you'll try harder next time.' 
                  Catastrophes are certainly nothing new to Peter
                  Hatcher, thanks to his younger brother Fudge.  And
                  now his parents have more surprises ... another baby
                  on the way, plus a move to New Jersey!  But the
                  worst thing of all is the way Peter's parents just
                  don't seem to understand what a mess things are
                  becoming.  Children won't be able to resist the
                  snappy dialogue and upbeat, crazy antics that keep
                  the story racing along." --container.
