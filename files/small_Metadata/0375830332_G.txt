To find her, they must travel back over 250 years ago to Venice, Italy, on the night of the annual Carnival celebration. But Merlin's directions are very confusing! As Jack and Annie wander among the costumed crowd, no one is who they seem to be, the clocks all tell different times, and water is mysteriously rising in the streets. Seeking help from Venice's ruler, they find themselves thrown into a dark dungeon filled with rats. How will Jack and Annie save themselves and the Grand Lady, too? There can only be one solution-magic! Mary Pope Osborne is a master of bringing faraway places to life. In Carnival at Candlelight she sends young readers to one of the most glorious cities in the world for an adventure filled with history, mystery, and magic.===
