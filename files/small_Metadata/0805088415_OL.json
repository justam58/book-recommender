As Callie explores the natural world around her, she develops a close relationship with her grandfather, navigates the dangers of living with six brothers, and comes up against just what it means to be a girl at the turn of the century.  Debut author Jacqueline Kelly deftly brings Callie and her family to life, capturing a year of growing up with unique sensitivity and a wry wit. - Publisher."}, "last_modified": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2012-07-26T08:34:29.346833"}, "key": "/books/OL22569103M", "authors": [{"name": "Jacqueline Kelly", "key": "/authors/OL5635911A"}], "publish_places": ["New York"], "pagination": "p. cm.", "created": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2008-11-16T09:20:08.135543"}, "dewey_decimal_class": ["[Fic]"], "identifiers": {"librarything": ["6812276"], "goodreads": ["6202556"]}, "isbn_13": ["9780805088410"], "lccn": ["2008040595"], "isbn_10": ["0805088415"], "publish_date": "2009", "works": [{"key": "/works/OL15021579W"}]}, "preview": "restricted"}}
