Description ===Seventh grade should be a wonderful year for Katie Roberts. After all, she has twin baby brothers and Lucie, the best friend ever. Too bad Mama doesn't understand that wearing lipstick is how you get invited to snobby Pamela's party. And too bad Miss Casey makes Katie tutor Rudy Pergolizzi, who wears funny pants and doesn't know how to play baseball and act crazy like other boys. As in THE PRIVATE NOTEBOOK OF KATIE ROBERTS, AGE 11, winner of the Nutmeg Award, Katie's characteristic humor and spunk vividly reveal her world of confusing boys, no-nap babies, and the pull and tug of being 12 and having to face growing up.===
