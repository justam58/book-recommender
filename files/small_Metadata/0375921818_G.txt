Description ===Roy Eberhardt is recently arrived in Florida. ‘Disney World is an armpit compared to Montana’, he announces. Roy’s family moves a lot so he’s used to the new-kid drill – and to bullies like Dana Matherson. And anyway, it’s because of Dana that Roy gets to see the mysterious running boy – who runs away from the school bus and who has no books, no backpack and, most oddly, no shoes. Sensing a mystery Roy starts to trail the mystery runner – a chase that will introduce him to many weird Floridian creatures: potty-trained alligators, some cute burrowing owls, a fake-fart champion, a sinister pancake PR man and some snakes with sparkly tails…Suddenly life in Florida is looking up!===
